Django signals are executed synchronously by default. This means that the signal handlers run in the same execution flow as the function that triggered the signal.

import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def slow_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler started")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a slow operation
    print("Signal handler completed")

# Simulate saving a user
user = User(username="testuser")
user.save()
print("User save function completed!")
